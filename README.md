Gift Tracker is the easiest way to plan gifts. Your friends and family will know exactly what you want, or would like for your birthday. Gift Tracker is an app that will help users plan group gifts and act like a registry for events. The app will focus on Birthdays to begin with, but may be expanded to include other events in the future - Christmas and Weddings, for example. 
 
Users can create a gift, adding a name, link, and price and may specify if the gift has been bought or not. The ‘Bought’ option may be updated at any time if the gift is purchased at a later date. 

Users will also be able to save gifts to view their gifts at a later stage. There will also be an option to find friends through Google+.

Google will also be used, along with Amazon Cognito, to provide security with user login.


Users will be able to
-	Login with Google
-	Browse for gifts on Amazon
-	Create a gift
-	Save a gift
-	View their saved gifts
-	Find friends with Google+
